NyayaSetu is a digital legal awareness and dispute-resolution platform designed to improve access to justice and strengthen trust in legal institutions. The platform helps citizens understand their rights, access legal information, and resolve minor disputes peacefully before unnecessary escalation to courts.

## 🌍 Problem Statement

In India, a large number of cases remain pending in courts, including High Courts and the Supreme Court. Many of these cases originate from minor civil disputes that could have been resolved earlier if citizens had better legal awareness and guidance. Complex legal procedures, lack of access to reliable information, and high costs discourage early resolution, leading to delayed justice and weakened trust in institutions.

## 💡 Solution

NyayaSetu addresses this problem by providing:
- Easy-to-understand legal awareness
- Clear information about constitutional rights and legal provisions
- AI-assisted legal information for awareness (not legal advice)
- Mediation-first dispute guidance for minor cases
- Responsible escalation guidance for serious matters

The platform focuses on **supporting** justice institutions, not replacing courts or legal professionals.
